# Network-Packet-Sniffer-
# Setting Up the Environment:
Choose a Java IDE (Integrated Development Environment) like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.
Download necessary libraries (Jpcap, JNetPcap) and add them to your project.
# Packet Capture:
Use Jpcap API to open a network interface for capturing packets.
Implement a loop to continuously capture packets and store them.
# Packet Decoding:
Write functions to parse captured packet data based on protocol headers (IP, TCP, UDP).
Extract relevant information like source/destination IP, ports, and packet payloads (if applicable).
Consider using libraries for easier header parsing.
# User Interface (Optional):
Design a GUI using Java Swing or JavaFX libraries.
Display captured packets in a table with relevant details.
Allow users to start/stop capturing, filter packets, or view details of a specific packet.
# Packet Analysis (Optional):
Implement logic to analyze captured packets based on your project goals.
This could involve identifying specific protocols, suspicious activity, or patterns in network traffic
